I had some bugs and other issues with my Wordpress side. Raihan was able to fix those bugs and issues very quickly and all this for a fair price. The communication was although very good, he talks fluent english and always responses very quickly to messages. To summ it up, I was really happy with the result and the service.

Raihan is just a outstanding talent with delivering solutions to Wordpress problems. If anybody needs a good hire I highly recommend this guy. I have been working with him for over a year now.

My favorite seller on Fiverr. I always think about hiring Raihan before anyone because he is very skilled and a good professional in especially webdesiging. But basically he can do any task you throw at him.

Romaple | Freelance agency owner

One of the cooperative freelancer I ever hired. He did the work before the time limit ends. He took care of my site and it's better than before now. I highly recommend everyone to hire him if they need anyone to get the job done. Regards, Shazia Saeed, CEO of rainofbeauty.com

I had a pesky plug-in bug that rendered changes to my Wordpress website useless. As a non-technical guy it would have taken me countless hours to work out and fix, and probably at great risk. Instead, I used WordPress48Hour and within a few email exchanges and an hour or so, and a small fee, the problem was fixed!

Roderick Lambert | Life & Executive Coaching – Mentoring – Career Guidance at Zivotjezmena.cz

👇🏼

Super easy and solved my problem with Wordpress quickly. Really helpful and able to explain all well. Will definitely use again and recommend the service.

Raihan is a great man and a great leader of his team. He takes care of all the UX of my website. He is awesome. Great guy. This is one guy you'll should use . He understands what you want and need and he delivers . His work ethics is amazing. so far he is my topmost fiver gig .. I will be using him going forward.
